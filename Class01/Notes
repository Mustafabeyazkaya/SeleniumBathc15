Selenium notes:
The Need
Why do we need to do testing?

What is the need for automation?
What is selenium?
•    Selenium is a tool
•    It helps you to do the automation of your websites
It supports various browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
It supports various programming languages like Java, Python, C# etc

“Please verify that you are a human”
IT IS A PROTECTION AGAINST AUTOMATION TOOL

Understanding How selenium integration works
Steps.
1.    Create an Intelij java project
2.    Download the selenium package
3.    Integrate the Selenium with the Intelij
4.    Download the chrome driver

Testing your first code
The approach -






In Java, a stack trace (sometimes called a backtrace) is a textual representation of the call stack at a specific point in time during the execution of a program.
It shows the sequence of method calls that led up to the current point of execution, including the line number and file name of each method in the call chain.

A remote stack trace refers to a stack trace that is obtained from a remote machine or process, typically over a network connection.
This can be useful for debugging distributed systems or client-server applications, where errors may occur on a remote machine that is not directly accessible to the developer.

To obtain a remote stack trace in Java, you can use tools such as a remote debugger or a logging framework that supports remote logging.
 The stack trace can then be analyzed to identify the cause of the error or exception, and to help determine the appropriate course of action to fix the issue.



 The APPROACH
 1. setProperty --> set the path to the chrome driver
 2. create an instance of the WebDriver
 3.use driver.get("URL") OR driver.navigate().to("URL")

  Selenium Class 1

  What is software testing?
  -- identify correctness and quality of the application

  How many ways can we actually test?
  -- manual
  -- automation

  When do we go for automation?
  -- after manual testing is passed
  -- when environment is stable
  -- analyze our test suite and choose our automation tools

  What other tools do we know for automation?
  -- Selenium, UFT/QTP, Cucumber, TestNG, Katalon Studio

  Levels of testing?
  -- Unit test
  -- Acceptance testing
  -- System testing
  -- Integration testing

  Types of Testing?
  -- Functional testing
  -- Non- Functional testing
      Performance testing
      Security testing

  What is Selenium?
  -- a set of tools which helps us to automate webb applications. It is mainly used
  to perform functional testing.


  What is Selenium WebDriver?
  Open source automation tool which allows us to perform actions on a web application
  WebDriver is an interface

  Advantages of Selenium WebDriver:
  -- open source
  -- works with different programming languages--> Java Ruby, C#, JavaScript, Python
  -- works with multiple browsers and supports cross browser testing
  -- OS independent --> iOS, Linux, Windows

  Disadvantages of Selenium WebDriver:
  -- No technical support
  -- Cannot test desktop applications
  -- no built in reports
  -- cannot test captchas, images, videos
  -- takes more time to create test cases

  get() vs navigate()
  -- navigate can move back, forward and refresh
  -- get() will wait for the page to fully load whereas navigate() will not
  -- get() will not keep the history of the browser whereas navigate() will

  close() vs quit()
  -- close() will close the current tab
  -- quit() will quit the whole browser

  fullscreen() vs maximize()
  -- maximize() will maximize the browser and you will still be able to see url, tabs, bookmarks
      and fullscreen() will maximize the whole web application
