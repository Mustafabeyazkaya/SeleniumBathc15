 We have 8 locators in Selenium
 1.ID
 2.Name
 3.Class name
 4.LinkText--> they can only be used with a link (that it must have a link tag <a> and it must have a text)
 5.Xpath
 6.Css
 7.TagName
 8.Partial Link text--> they can only be


 Why do we need so many locators?
 -- sometimes there might be a locator with duplicate value
 <input id ="email", name ="a">

 <input id ="email", name ="b">

 -- sometimes the developers might not provide you with all the locators

 there are some important things that you should remember while selecting a locator...

 if a attribute value has a number in it, it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator.!!!!



 "LinkedText" is used to locate web elements based on the exact text of a hyperlink
 vs "PartialLinkText" is used to locate web elements based on a partial match of the text of a hyperlink.


 What did we learn today?
 Locators:
 locators in selenium help us to find the WebElements
 8 locators we have
 id,name,className
 Link-text,partialLink-text (they can only be used for <a> and it must also have some text)
 TagName (we just need to pass the tagname and it is going to find that particular webElement)

 DOM --> document object model
 here we have whole code for the website

 Scenario:
 if there are two elements with the same attribute value what will happen?

 selenium is going to et the first one it encounters.




 Moazzam:
 What is a WebElement?
 anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement
 e.g. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

 HTML?
 HyperText Markup Language

 What is DOM?
 DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
 internal view of the webpage.
 Also called as Developer's tools, or Dev tools
 Document --> can be stored any document as pdf, excel
 Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
 Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

 Locator
 is an address or a position of an webelement on the web page
 is used to locate or identify webelements on the webpage

 8 Locators:
 - ID
 - Name
 - Tagname
 - xpath
 - linktext
 - partialLinkText
 - CSS Selector
 - ClassName

 Linktext, partialLintext (they can only be used for <a> and it must also have some Text)


 Why do we need many locators?
 -- some locators might have duplicate values in other nodes
 -- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
 -- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
     e.g. linkText and partialLinkText is only used for Links




 "a" tag is also called an anchor tag, its for the link ...
 it must have a link and the text .. the text is going to be there almost everytime


 if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values, Selenium will only interact with the
 first element it locates, we try to find elements as uniquely as possible





 there are some important things that you should remember while selecting a locator...

 if a attribute value has a number in it , it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator.!!!!!



 differnce in linkText and partial link Text?

 a parital link text you can use just a part of text, just make sure that it is unqiue enough to stand out .
