***************Selenium Class 05*****************

Approach to select checkbox single

1. inspect the checkbox
2. write down the correct locator in the DOM
3. use ".findElement" to find the check box
4. click on it

if i want to check that check box is selected or not?
        checkbox.isSelected(): --> TRUE (means selected)

Preferred Approach ,when it comes to multiple checkboxes

1. inspect then in the DOM
2. write the locator in such a way that it is able to select all the required checkboxes
3. use "findElements" to get all those checkboxes
4. iterate through the list
5. while iteration look for your desired checkbox (inspect the DOM to see which information provides you the indication that this is your desired checkbox)
6. if the condition to make the selection

============================================================================

Drop Down:

Two Types:

1.Single Select
2.Multi Select

----------

When it comes to Drop Down, we have a class in selenium that help us interact with them

-------->Select Class:------> in order to be able to use the class your drop down must be made in the DOM using the SELECT tag

Single Select Drop Down---->

Approach:
1.inspect the Drop Down
2.Check if it has the select tag
3.Write down the locator to find the WebElement drop down
4.Declare an object of the select class(pass the WebElement in the parameters)
5.use methods from select class to select the desired option.
----->SelectByVisibleText();
----->SelectByIndex();
----->SelectByValue();



Multi Select Drop Down------>

Approach:
1.inspect the Drop Down
2.Check if it has the select tag
3.Write down the locator to find the WebElement drop down
4.Declare an object of the select class(pass the WebElement in the parameters)
5.use methods from select class to select the desired option.

-----------> you can use Deselect Methods also in case of multi select drop down

-------> to check if dropDown is multiSelect  or ni=ot you can use isMultiple--> returns a boolean true if it is a multi select drop down

------------------------Alerts--------------
alerts are the pop-up windows that appear and without dealing with them you can not proceed on with doing anything else

you can nit inspect them.

3 Types of Alerts;

1.Java Script alerts------> using SwitchTo commands.
2.Html based alerts--->



Moazzam:
Approach to select the single checkbox:

Inspect the checkbox.
Write down the correct locator in the DOM.
Use findElement to find the checkbox.
Click on it.
If you want to check whether the checkbox is selected or not:

checkbox.isSelected(); // returns true if selected
Preferred approach for selecting multiple checkboxes:

Inspect them in the DOM.
Write the locator in such a way that it is able to select all the required checkboxes.
Use findElements to get all those checkboxes.
Iterate through the list.
While iterating, look for your desired checkbox (inspect the DOM to see which information provides you the indication that this is your desired checkbox).
Use an if statement to make the selection.
..............................................Drop Down.....................................................

Drop Down:

Two types:

Single select
Multi-select
When it comes to drop-downs, we have a class in Selenium that helps us interact with them:

Select class - in order to be able to use this class, your dropdown must be made in the DOM using the SELECT tag.
Single Select Drop Down Approach:

Inspect the dropdown.
Check if it has the SELECT tag.
Write down the locator to find the WebElement dropdown.
Declare an object of the Select class (pass the WebElement in the parameters).
Use methods from the Select class to select the desired option:
selectByVisibleText();
selectByValue();
selectByIndex();
Multi-Select Drop Down Approach:

Inspect the dropdown.
Check if it has the SELECT tag.
Write down the locator to find the WebElement dropdown.
Declare an object of the Select class (pass the WebElement in the parameters).
Use methods to select the desired option:
selectByVisibleText();
selectByValue();
selectByIndex();
You can also use deselect methods in case of a multi-select dropdown.
To check if the dropdown is multi-select or not, you can use the isMultiple() method, which returns a boolean true if it is a multi-select dropdown.
Note: Indexing starts from 0 if the first option is not disabled, and indexing starts from 1 if the first option is disabled.

---------------------Alerts------------------------------

Alerts are the popup windows that appear and without dealing with them, you cannot proceed with doing anything else. You cannot inspect them.

Three types of alerts:

JavaScript alerts --> using SwitchTo commands.
HTML-based alerts/popups --> we can deal with them like other WebElements.
Window-based --> we cannot deal with them using Selenium.
JavaScript alerts:

Simple alert.
Confirmation alert.
Prompt alert.
You deal with all of them in the exact same way.

--------------------------Switch To Window--------------------------------------

Every time you open a new window, there is a unique handle attached to it, which is a unique code.

.getWindowHandle(): Returns the handle for the current window on which the focus is.
.getWindowHandles(): Returns the window handles of all the opened windows in a set of strings.
It is a set because the driver doesn't know which window opened up first.
